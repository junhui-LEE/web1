   <h2> CSS이란 무엇인가? </h2>
   <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style s
     heet language used for describing the presen
     tation of a document written in a markup lan
     guage like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone techno
     logy of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML a
     nd JavaScript.[2]
     ation and content, including layout, colors, and fo
     nts.[3] This separation can improve content accessi
     bility, provide more flexibility and control in the
     specification of presentation characteristics, enable
     multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
     the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
     complexity and repetition in the structural content.
